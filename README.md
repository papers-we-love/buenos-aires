# Papers We ❤️ Buenos Aires

This is the repository for the Buenos Aires chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/buenos-aires/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

In the spirit of the "Papers We Love" groups around the globe, we want to start our own version in Buenos Aires. Papers We Love (PWL) is a community built around reading, discussing, and learning more about academic computer science papers.

What was the last paper you read and loved within the realm of computing? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come and share the ideas of an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, scientists, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown on the paper. It is also okay to just come, listen, and discuss!

We are curating this repository for papers presented at Papers We Love @ Buenos Aires. You can contribute by adding pull request for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories, like the main Papers We Love repository.

### When and Where?

### Who are we?

We are developers, engineers, academics, and other professionals interested in discussing computer science papers. Whether you're a computer science student, a software engineer, or any other professional, we welcome you to join us. The only requirements are to be curious and eagerness to learn!

### Why?

Because learning and pushing your intellectual boundaries is an effective way to stay relevant in a world that moves fast. Likewise, learning is a funny activity!

### How?

Reading a paper is not the same as reading a novel or a blogpost. These are few resources to help you get started.
